I am Luqman Muhammad Zagi, a dedicated researcher and lecturer specializing in digital security, and privacy. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at Radboud University Nijmegen, focusing on large-scale web security and privacy measurements. With a strong academic background in electrical engineering from Institut Teknologi Bandung, my research and professional work span various domains, including digital forensics, malware analysis, and network security.

Beyond academia, I have extensive experience mentoring cybersecurity professionals and contributing to national and international projects on digital security. As a certified trainer in Cisco, EC-Council, and RedHat technologies, I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. My goal is to advance cybersecurity awareness and solutions through research, education, and collaborative initiatives.
